The __construct() method is automatically called when the object is first created. This means you can inject parameters and dependencies to set up the object.

When an object is destroyed the __destruct() method is fired. Again, as with the __construct() method, this is not something you have to trigger as PHP will take care of it for you.

The destruct method will allow you to cleanup anything that shouldn’t be around once the object has been destroyed.To be honest you don’t really see much of the __destruct() method. PHP is not really the type of language that you would be using for long running processes so I think for the most part you don’t really need to ever clean up anything using the __destruct() method. The lifecycle of a PHP request is so short, actually implementing the __destruct() method is probably more hassle than it’s worth
