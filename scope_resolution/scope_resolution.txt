The Scope Resolution Operator or in simpler terms, the double colon, is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

Three special keywords self, parent and static are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition.
When an extending class overrides the parents definition of a method, PHP will not call the parent's method. It's up to the extended class on whether or not the parent's method is called. This also applies to Constructors and Destructors, Overloading, and Magic method definitions.
