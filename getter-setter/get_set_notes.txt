What is getter and setters
'Getters' and 'Setters' are object methods that allow you to control access to a certain class variables / properties.
Sometimes, these functions are referred to as 'mutator methods'. A 'getter' allows to you to retrieve or 'get' a given
property. A 'setter' allows you to 'set' the value of a given property.


Why use getters and setters? What is the point?
The getters and setters that we created in our Person class above are pretty pointless as they merely provide access to our private
properties. Beyond that, they don’t do anything.
However, what if we wanted to add a layer of validation to prevent our object from being misused? For example, what if we wanted to make
sure that the person’s $name variable is a string variable and not something else? Well, we can simply add that layer of validation
to our setter method
