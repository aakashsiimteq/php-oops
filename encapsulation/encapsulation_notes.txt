What is encapsulation?
As we know, every PHP class has a property (variable) and behavior (function and method). Combining property and
behavior in a single unit class is known as Encapsulation.

Let’s understand encapsulation with some real-time example that plays around us. Now a day, usage of bank ATM is very
common. We all are performing operations on the ATM machine like cash withdrawal, money transfer, retrieve
mini-statement…etc.Have you ever think that what is happening behind all this? The answer you will get is very simple,
no.It’s a correct answer. It means that background process was hidden from the end-user or customer, why?
The answer is very simple to make its data secure and robust. In PHP, encapsulation does the same thing to
make a code more secure and robust. Using encapsulation, we are hiding the real implementation of data from
the end-user.
